This app shows a product list of 10 items. it first asks what is the id number of the product that you want to buy. after the user inouts the id number then it accesses whether the item is instock. if not instock it says limited available. if available it deducts from original,updates stock(this doesnt show unitl app is ran again) and adds total. Both instances ask the user if they want to shop again(this confirm only works when an item has limited stock). I included screenshots of this in images folder.
